# drewCoPyTools #
This is a simple set of common tools that I use for Python projects.
The goal is to reduce boilerplate, and to create functionality that works like other programming languages, vs. whatever python wants to do.

## tools
General tools.  Mostly stuff that solves Python's inability to be cross-platform.

+ **subprocess_really** : Like subprocess.call, but doesn't require different conventions depending on the current OS.

## filetools
Simplifies many common filesystem tasks.


## datetimetools
Helps with dealing with datetimes, especially UTC.

## logtools
Simplifies many logging tasks.    
<strike>Uses drewCo standard logging formats and conventions, including contexts.</strike>

## jsontools
Helpful functions to make dealing with json less of a pain.
