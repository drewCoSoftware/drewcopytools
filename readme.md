# drewCoPyTools #
This is a simple set of common tools that I use for Python projects.
The goal is to reduce boilerplate, and to create functionality that works like other programming languages, vs. whatever python wants to do.


## filetools
Simplifies many common filesystem tasks.


## datetimetools
Helps with dealing with datetimes, especially UTC.

## logtools
Simplifies many logging tasks.
